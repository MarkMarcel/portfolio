I built an in-app video ad platform for retail apps, delivering dynamic, context-aware storytelling right inside the shopper journey. These ads consistently outperform static formats, driving 2–3× higher click-through rates and improved ROAS. Fully compliant with IAB measurement standards, the solution bridges brand awareness and in-store conversion, all while integrating seamlessly into retailer-owned mobile experiences.
