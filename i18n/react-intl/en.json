  "about1": "Hello! I'm Mark, a software engineer from Ghana with a strong belief in the power of technology to drive progress. At about 10, I had a childhood dream to contribute to the development of my country. That interest led me to consider economics, so I chose to study Economics, Mathematics and Computer Science. Over time, I realised that technology offered a more direct and scalable way to make a difference. Since then, I have followed a simple idea: make the most of my potential and use it to solve meaningful problems. My journey began with building tools to improve school operations at <a>Infoview</a>.",
  "about2": "Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the opportunity to work with a range of <link>companies</link>, contributing to products that deliver real value to users. I enjoy problem solving and exploration, and software engineering gives me space to apply those skills in a practical and creative way. Outside of work, I take part in communities that are focused on advancing technology such as <a>Ghana NLP</a>.",
  "about3": "I moved to Germany in 2025 and am currently looking for a role where I can continue to grow, contribute to meaningful projects and learn from those around me. In my free time, I enjoy discovering new ideas, tools and ways of thinking, exploring outdoors and playing video games.",
